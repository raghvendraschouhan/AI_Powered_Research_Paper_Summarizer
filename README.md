###üìö Research Paper Summarizer
The Research Paper Summarizer is an AI-powered tool designed to streamline the process of summarizing research papers. This project utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and summarize key sections of a research paper, enabling researchers, students, and professionals to quickly grasp the essence of academic content.

###‚ú® Features
Automatic Section Extraction: Automatically detects and extracts sections like Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion from research papers.
AI-Powered Summarization: Summarizes sections using state-of-the-art models like DistilBART, providing concise and coherent summaries.
PDF Processing: Supports PDF uploads to extract text and metadata.
Figures and Captions Extraction: Identifies and extracts figure captions for better context.
Visual Analytics:
Section-wise word count distribution.
Sentence length distribution in the research paper.
ROUGE Score Calculation: Compares generated summaries with original text to evaluate performance.
###üí° Use Cases
Research: Quickly comprehend the main points of academic papers without reading the entire document.
Education: Assists students in reviewing large volumes of research material efficiently.
Industry: Helps professionals stay updated with the latest research in their field.
###üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
transformers for NLP summarization models.
nltk for text preprocessing and tokenization.
PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
streamlit for an interactive web interface.
Models: Pre-trained DistilBART summarization model from Hugging Face.
###üöÄ How It Works
Upload PDF: Users upload a PDF file of a research paper.
Text Extraction: The tool extracts text and metadata from the PDF.
Section Identification: Key sections are identified using predefined patterns.
Summarization: Each section is summarized using the summarization model.
Visualization: Provides insights through word count distribution and sentence length analysis.
Evaluation: Calculates ROUGE scores for performance benchmarking.
